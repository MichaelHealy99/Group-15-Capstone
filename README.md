# Project 85: Combining Wavelets and Neural Nets
## Project Description:

Wavelets and its derivatives had been a cornerstone in applied mathematics which are used to
analyze imaging and textured data broadly. When compared to traditional neural network
methods, wavelets and its derivatives maybe easier to understand and more interpretable.
Our project here aims to combine wavelets and its variants with neural networks and develop
architecture that can perform equally well (or better) than SOTA. We will apply these networks
on astrophysical dataset which is very textured, and also common datasets such as ImageNet.



## Data:


The data are ready and publicly available. They include day-to-day images/videos, and
astrophysical simulations .The students do not need to gather the data.

## Project Scope:

The project is probably best done by 2-4 students. We anticipate 5-10 hours a week during the
capstone project.

## Success Criteria:

## Background:
Familiarity with network architecture building. Language wise: Pytorch / tensorflow / etc. Passion
/ curiosity for science in general. Willingness to learn some science as well.

## Organization Background:
The students will work directly with Shirley Ho, Group Leader of Cosmology X Data Science at
Flatiron Institute and NYU affiliate faculty at CDS and Physics. The students will also interact
with the many postdocs and students within the Center for Computational Astrophysics. In
particular, the students will likely work directly with one or two other Flatiron fellows whose
expertise are in machine learning and astrophysics (respectively). The students will be
encouraged to participate in various group meetings, ML reading groups, computational
methods and data science journal clubs, etc. Shirley Ho intends to spend 5 hours a week
working with the project team, while the two fellows may spend around 5-7 hours a week
working with the project team.
## NDA requirements:
### NDA required: No.

## Mentoring modality:
